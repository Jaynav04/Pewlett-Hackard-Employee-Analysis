# Topic
Itâ€™s been two weeks since I was hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). My first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

In this project, my tasks involved designing tables to accommodate data from CSV files, importing those CSV files into a SQL database, and subsequently addressing data-related inquiries. To elaborate, I carried out data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis in that order.

# Tools Used
- QuickDBD
- pgAdmin 4
- PostgresSQL

## Project is broken up into the following steps
1. Data Modeling
2. Data Engineering
3. Data Analysis

# Data Modeling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables using QuickDBD

# Data Engineering (Data Modeling)

Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:

- I must specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

- For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite key which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.

- Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
